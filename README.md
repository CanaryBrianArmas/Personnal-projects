# Data Science portfolio

On this repository I am gonna upload the projects I worked on or currently working on. These projects are written in Python (Jupyter Noteook).

## Projects:

### [Predicction of football WorldCup 2022](https://github.com/CanaryBrianArmas/Personnal-projects/tree/main/Proyectos_an%C3%A1lisis/Predicci%C3%B3n_Mundial_2022_Python)

In this project I did webscraping to fetch the structure of the football WorldCup 2022 before it had been played. Then, I use inference statistics to try to predict the possible result of the tournament.

Must-have libraries:
* Pandas
* Bs4
* from string import ascii_uppercase
* import pickle
* from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
* import requests 
* from scipy.stats import poisson


### [EDA_Entrega](https://github.com/CanaryBrianArmas/Personnal-projects/tree/main/Proyectos_an%C3%A1lisis/EDA_Entrega)

In thia project I made an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to get valuable and interesting insights from the [Harry Potter CSV]()
